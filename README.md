**This is my personal portfolio website**

Nothing fancy just a sleek and plain website that I wanted to build for myself to up my design skills.

Feel free to use the design if you want to. Just fork it and you're good to go.

The website is currently only including a main page.

Future features are:

- a resume viewer
- a blog

Have fun!!!
